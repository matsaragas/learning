What is PyTorch?

From the definition as per the official website, PyTorch is an open-source machine learning
framework that accelerates the path from research prototyping to production deployment. 
It is a development tool that removes cognitive overhead involved in building, training and
deploying neural networks. 

The PyTorch framework runs on Python and is based on the Torch library 
(Lua-based deep learning framework).
