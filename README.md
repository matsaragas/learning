What is the main Difference between Pytorch and TensorFlow

**What is PyTorch?**

From the definition as per the official website, PyTorch is an open-source machine learning
framework that accelerates the path from research prototyping to production deployment. 
It is a development tool that removes cognitive overhead involved in building, training and
deploying neural networks. 

The PyTorch framework runs on Python and is based on the Torch library 
(Lua-based deep learning framework). 

**What is TensorFlow?**

As per the definition from the official website, TensorFlow
is an end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning.
It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, 
libraries and community resources that lets researchers 
push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily 
build and deploy ML-powered applications. TensorFlow is by 
far one of the most popular deep learning frameworks. 
It is developed by Google Brain and supports languages like
Python, C++ and R.

TensorFlow uses dataflow graphs to process data. Nodes in 
the graph represent mathematical operations, while the 
graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays 
(tensors) that flow between them. As you build these neural
networks, you can look at how the data flows through the 
neural network.
